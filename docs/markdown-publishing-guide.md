# Markdown Publishing Guide v1.0.1-prerelease
A guide to publishing Markdown documents on GitHub and ReadTheDocs

## Introduction
This is a guide to writing and publishing Markdown documents on GitHub and ReadTheDocs.
It includes steb-by-step instructions for using GitHub, git, Markdown, and ReadTheDocs in order to
produce a well-formatted set of documents with a detailed table of contents.

This document itself was created using the instructions in this document.

## Motivation
This document was created to help others write documents in Markdown and have them look good on both GitHub and ReadTheDocs.
By "good" I mean that on ReadTheDocs it has a table of contents page and there is a left navigation pane with topics
that expands hierarchically.

It took a while to figure out how to setup my files on GitHub in a way would produce good results so I 
decided to document the procedures I came up with. I also included a very basic git workflow to support multiple versions.

These instructions are published with Creative Commons Zero license which basically says
you can do what you want with this content and you don't have to add any attributions
or do anything really - just copy it.

## Scope
These instructions are intended for standalone documents, like this one, that do not require
a sophisticated git branching and collaboration workflow.
However, you can also ignore my suggested git workflow and subsitute your own in order to support collaboration.

## Preparing for Development
* Create GitHub Account
* Create ReadTheDocs Account
* Setup Connection to GitHub in ReadTheDocs

## Setting up a New Project

### Creating a GitHub Repo with Initial Content

#### Create docs/user-guide.md with initial content
This document assumes your initial version is v0.0.0 but you can choose a different initial version.
If you pick an initial version other than v0.0.0 then replace v0.0.0 throughout
the rest of this document with your chosen version.
